Recursive Process... Here, function fName(i) has void return type,
and i=5, I,II,III, and I recursive calls.
You can check the recursive call and return through the arrow direction.
Also, check below the stack memory allocation during recursion and 
deallocation after call is over.

you can write a recursive algorithm for factorial calculation
and also try to represent the recursive call by using above method for n=5 by pen n paper.
